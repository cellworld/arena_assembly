# Cellworld Arena Assembly
All parts of the arena assembly can be found in STEP files of this github repository. However, to see how the parts assemble on 
a web browswer, you can use this [Onshape link](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c8897f9f1e8291dd2da7ef89/w/1c35d23167742132946594eb/e/1fb43747d3ac53d540c92c7f?renderMode=0&uiState=64f8d54faca3cb0d59202402z)

The onshape document is composed of both part studios (from which all components are derived from) and assemblies to see how parts fit together.
The assemblies will be the first files you see. You can both manipulate objects within the assemblies and export them to whatever file you need.

Components of the arena can be devised into three components: the arena itself, the automated door system, and the obstacles. 
Construction within each of these categories will be described below, but all parts are derived from either laser-cut acrylic or 3D printing.
Parts that need to be 3D printed will have the string "3D_PRINT" inserted at the beginning of the part's name.
